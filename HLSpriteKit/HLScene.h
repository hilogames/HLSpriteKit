/**
 A mode specifying how hit-testing should work in a gesture recognition system.

 @bug Seemingly obvious, but currently unimplemented, would be a mode where intersecting
      nodes are collected by `[SKNode nodesAtPoint]` and then traversed in order of
      `zPosition` (highest to lowest).  `HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeZPosition`,
      presumably.  But parent-traversal is already coded, and works in simple cases, so
      I'm delaying implementation until I have a use-case for `zPosition`-only.  It's
      worth noting that `SpriteKit` does not seem optimized to do hit-testing by
      `zPosition`, so that even implementing
      `HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeZPositionThenParent` means accepting some pretty
      crazy computation on every gesture (further complicated by my desire to use
      `UIGestureRecognizers`), and whenever I start implementing z-position-only hit
      testing I think "SpriteKit doesn't want me to do it this way."  If I really do want
      to ignore the node tree, then maybe what I want is to make my own hit-testing
      algorithm, too.  It's possible I could make a simpler system: Gesture targets
      specifying their own hit boxes and layering, independent of their
      `calculateAccumulatedFrame` and `zPosition`.

 @bug Okay, I had one use case: I wanted to flash the entire scene white, and so naively I
      overlaid a white sprite node on the scene and animated its alpha.  Gesture handling
      started with the highest z-position object, which was the white node, because it was
      over everything.  In particular, it covered over multiple gesture targets which I
      still wanted to work.  (If there were just one target enabled, then I could make the
      white node the child of that target, and gestures would fall through according to
      the "ThenParent" of the hit test mode.  But that doesn't work for multiple covered
      targets.)  I preferred to work around the problem (by flashing white in a different
      way), but it still makes a good use case.  The opposite case is this: It's nice to
      be able to disable interaction in the scene by covering everything with a matte
      which has a top-level parent.  However, that function is not impossible when doing
      `HLSceneGestureTargetHitTestModeZPosition` (for example, the matte could be itself a
      gesture target which explicitly does nothing).  One more idea along these lines:
      Rather than having a scene-wide mode, could each node in the tree (optionally) have
      its own mode?  Like, the scene mode is to find the first target, either "deepest" or
      "z-position", but then that first target is queried to see how to traverse the node
      tree, whether by node parent or z-position?  Or it could have an explicit "gesture
      parent node", but that probably wouldn't be dynamic enough.  Again, almost tempted
      to have HLScene make its own gesture tree, independent of the SpriteKit node tree.

 @bug Another argument in favor of hit-testing by z-position and/or a tree other than the
      SpriteKit general-purpose node tree: I have a `worldNode` which contains the world
      of the game, and can be panned and zoomed and shaken.  Interface elements (status
      bars, minimaps, whatever) show above that world in z-position, but are not children
      of that world node, since I don't want them moving around with the world.  And yet
      that's a problem for hit testing order: Supposedly an inteface element can say a
      gesture is "not absorbed" by the element, but in that case it needs to fall through
      to the world, which is, again, not the parent of the interface element.  My solution
      (in a real world example) was to no longer let the world be a gesture target, but
      instead to have all gestures not handled by a special interface element fall through
      to the scene controller.  Of course, that kinda defeats the purpose of
      HLGestureTarget.

 `HLScene` contains functionality useful to many scenes, including but not limited to:

   - loading scene assets in a background thread

   - registration of nodes for common scene-related behaviors (for example, resizing when
     the scene resizes, and not encoding when the scene encodes)

   - a shared gesture recognition system and an `HLGestureTarget`-aware gesture delegate
     implementation

   - modal presentation of a node above the scene

 ## Shared Gesture Recognition System

 `HLScene` includes a gesture recognition system that can forward `UIGestureRecognizer`
 gestures to `HLGestureTarget` nodes.  The system implementation works by magic and does
 exactly what you want it to without configuration.  If, however, you do not want to
 partake in the mysteries, do not call `needSharedGestureRecognizers*`.

 ### Subclassing Notes for the Shared Gesture Recognition System

 - The `HLScene` calls the `needSharedGestureRecognizers:` method to create gesture
   recognizers for any gesture recognizers needed by `HLGestureTarget` nodes registered
   with `registerDescendant:withOptions:`.

 - Subclasses shall call the `needSharedGestureRecognizers:` to create any other needed
   gesture recognizers.  The method is safe to call multiple times, and will only create
   gesture recognizers if an equivalent one (according to
   `HLGestureTarget_areEquivalentGestureRecognizers()`) is not already created.

 - The `HLScene` implementation of `[SKScene didMoveToView:]` adds any created gesture
   recognizers to the view.  The implementation of `[SKScene willMoveFromView:]` removes
   them.  (Gesture recognizers created in between will add themselves to the scene's view
   automatically.)

 - The entry point for the shared gesture recognition system in action is
   `gestureRecognizer:shouldReceiveTouch:`.  Subclasses overriding that method should call
   `super` in order to allow the shared gesture recognition system to find targets and
   forward gestures.

/**
 Registers a node (a descendant in the scene's node tree) for various automatic behavior
 in the scene.

 See documentation of `HLSceneChild*` values.

 In general it is not strictly required that the node be currently part of the scene's
 node tree, but certain options might assume it.

 Custom behavior attempts to be extremely low-overhead for non-registered nodes, so that
 scenes can subclass `HLScene` and only subscribe to the desired behavior without other
 impact.  Some memory overhead is to be expected, both for the class and for registered
 nodes; nodes can be unregistered by `unregisterDescendant:`.

 Failure to unregister nodes often has little functional impact, but it will retain
 references unnecessarily.

 @bug One problem with the current design, for the record: Each node (usually) gets
      retained in a collection for its feature.  If many nodes are registered, then the
      memory use will be significant.  That said, the options do not lend themselves to
      widespread use on lots and lots of nodes in the scene.

 @bug An alternate design would be to put requests for scene behavior in the nodes
      themselves (perhaps by having them conform to protocols, or perhaps by having them
      subclass a `HLNode` class which can track desired options).  Then, children in the
      scene don't need to be added specially; they can be discovered during normal adding
      with addChild:, or else discovered lazily (by scanning the node tree) when needed.
      The main drawback seems to be an invisible performance impact (no matter how small)
      for the `HLScene` subclass.  With explicit registration, the subclasser can be
      relatively confident that nothing is going on that wasn't requested.
