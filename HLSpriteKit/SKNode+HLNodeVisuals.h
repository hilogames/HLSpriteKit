/**
 Convenience method for creating a (single) shadow for the node.

 The shadow is returned as a separate node, to be inserted into the node tree by the
 caller as desired.

 The shape and properties are determined by copying self.  This means, of course, that any
 properties of the node which are set at this call will be shared by the shadow, and any
 properties set after this call will not.

/**
 Convenience method for creating a "multi-shadow" for the node.

 The multi-shadow gives a glow or outline effect.  The effect is achieved as follows:

   - First, the correct shape is created by copying the original node multiple times at
     radial offsets from a center point.

   - Next, the shape is replaced by the passed color using an effect node with a
     color-clamp filter.

   - Finally, the colorized shape is blurred using an effect node with a Gaussian filter.

 The multiple copies of this node will share any copyable properties of the node at
 the time of this call, but of course will not be updated after this call.  The caller
 should be careful, therefore, with the timing of the creation of this multi-shadow.

 @param offset The distance of the offset of the shadows (extending radially from the
               center).

 @param shadowCount The number of shadows drawn.  The first copy is offset in the
                    direction of `initialTheta` radians in polar coordinates; the other
                    copies are offset at regular subdivisions of the unit circle.  For
                    instance, if `initialTheta` is `0` and `shadowCount` is `4`, the
                    shadows will be drawn directly right, up, left, and down.

 @param initialTheta The direction of the offset of the first shadow, in radians.  (`0`
                     represents right, and the positive direction is counter-clockwise.)

 @param blur The blur radius for the multi-shadow shape.

 @param color The color for the multi-shadow shape.

 @warning Performance not measured.  Assume this is slow and memory-intensive.
