 The hierarchical menu navigated by the menu node (readonly).

 For the sake of simplicity, menu node does not worry about updating its display when
 the caller makes changes to the individual menu items.  Instead, it will only refresh
 the display after a call to `setMenu:animation:`, `redisplayMenuAnimation:`, or from
 manual or programmatic navigation of the menu.  The readonly attribute helps to suggest
 this pattern.  (The menu is retained, though, not copied, and so the caller is still
 able to change submenus and items within the menu.  Again, though, those changes will
 not be displayed until the HLMenuNode is explicitly redisplayed or navigated.)

 @bug It is considered convenient for the menu node to keep a strong reference to its
      menu, assuming that the caller typically wants a single fairly-static menu
      hierarchy.  An alternate design, perhaps where only "current" menu is tracked,
      and submenus or parent menus are returned dynamically from delegate calls, should
      be considered if useful.

 Default prototype button for items in the menu.

 Buttons are typed using "duck typing": They must be descended from `SKNode` and must
 additionally respond to the following selectors: `setText:(NSString *)`, `(CGSize)size`,
 and `setAnchorPoint:(CGPoint)`.  A good class to use is `HLLabelButtonNode`.  Selectors
 will be checked at runtime.

 This prototype is used if no other more-specific prototype is specified.  In particular,
 a prototype for an item is found in the following order, from most-specific to
 least-specific:

 - The `[HLMenuItem buttonPrototype]` property, if set;

 - otherwise, the `[HLMenuNode menuItemButtonPrototype]` for `HLMenu`s, if set, and the
   `[HLMenuNode backItemButtonPrototype]` for `HLMenuBackItem`s, if set;

 - otherwise, this `[HLMenuNode itemButtonPrototype]`.

 All buttons in the menu hierarchy must have a button prototype, or an exception is
 raised at runtime.  Setting this property (`itemButtonPrototype`) is the easiest way to
 ensure prototypes for all items.
