/**
 Calculates and returns the size of the source texture for this texture.

 When this texture is a sub-rectangle of a source texture, its `textureRect` defines
 the sub-rectangle in unit coordinate space.  The size returned by this method is a
 simple division of the `textureRect` by the texture `size`, but with one twist: A
 sub-texture of an atlas texture might be rotated (a quarter turn clockwise), and so
 the size dimensions might need to be swapped.

 This method is useful for OpenGL shaders using v_tex_coord on textures that are
 sub-rectangles of a source texture (especially atlas sprite sheets).
