/**
 HLLabelButtonNode displays a label over a textured or colored background.  It
 intentionally mimics an `SKLabelNode` on top of a `SKSpriteNode`, but has extra sizing
 and alignment options.

 ## Common User Interaction Configurations

 You might think this node, as a so-called "button", would have more options for handling
 user interaction (whether as a gesture target, a `UIResponder`, or an `NSResponder`).
 However, it does not, because the handling code would be so basic that it would seem
 ridiculous.  For instance, should every button in the scene keep a pointer to a delegate,
 and invoke delegate callbacks for interaction?  Seems unnecessary.  Instead, the button
 is mostly used in composing more-complicated components.  For instance, `HLMenuNode`
 keeps a collection of `HLLabelButtonNode` objects, and handles the interaction for all of
 them.

 That said, under the gesture target system, any node can be configured as a gesture
 target.  `HLLabelButtonNode` just doesn't have a self-as-target implementation as, for
 instance, `HLGridNode` does.

 As a gesture target:

 * Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.

 * Allocate a `HLTapGestureTarget`, initialize it with a block for execution on tap, and
   set it as gesture target (using `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget hlSetGestureTarget]`).

 * For double-tap, long press, or other gestures, set a custom `HLGestureTarget`
   instead.

 Using the default value, the baseline of the label text will appear to jump around when
 the text changes (for most fonts).  Furthermore, the baselines of two label buttons
 side-by-side will probably be different.  An alternative to consider is
 `HLLabelHeightModeAscenderBias`, which keeps the baselines consistent and does a pretty
 good job of visually centering various text strings in most fonts.
