/**
 HLLabelButtonNode displays a label over a textured or colored background.  It
 intentionally mimics an `SKLabelNode` on top of a `SKSpriteNode`, but has extra sizing
 and alignment options.

 ## Common Gesture Handling Configurations

 * Leave the gesture target unset for no gesture handling.

 * Allocate a `HLTapGestureTarget`, initialize it with a block for execution on tap, and
   set it as gesture target (via `[SKNode+HLGestureTarget hlSetGestureTarget]`).

 * For double-tap, long press, or other gestures, set a custom `HLGestureTarget`
   instead.

 @bug There is no current self-as-target option for `HLLabelButtonNode` (as there is in,
      for example, `HLGridNode` and `HLMenuNode`).  It would be pretty easy to make one: A
      callback block for taps, probably.  But of course that functionality is pretty
      easily specified by instantiating a tap delegate.  Other components have
      more-complex interactions (e.g. for `HLGridNode`, not just that a tap occurred, but
      *which* square it occurred on) (and e.g. for `HLMenuNode`, both `shouldTap` and
      `didTap` delegate methods).  The button might be too generic and simple to have a
      natural self-as-target built-in behavior.
