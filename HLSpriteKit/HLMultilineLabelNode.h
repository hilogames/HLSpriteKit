/**
 HLMultilineLabelNode is a node capable of displaying multiple lines of text.

 The current implementation works by rendering an image of the text and displaying it in a
 private sprite node.  (Another common implementation, not currently used here, is to
 create one `SKLabelNode` for each line.)

 The interface is similar to `SKLabelNode`; however, see `widthMaximum` to control line
 breaks, and see `anchorPoint` and `alignment` to control vertical and horizontal text
 alignment.

 @bug In iOS 8.4 and earlier, `widthMaximum` works more like a suggestion than a limit.
      Its behavior is determined by `[NSAttributedString
      boundingRectWithSize:options:context:]` which notes

        > However, the actual bounding rectangle returned by this method can be larger
        > than the constraints if additional space is needed to render the entire
        > string. Typically, the renderer preserves the width constraint and adjusts the
        > height constraint as needed.

      In iOS 8.4 and earlier, the width would usually not, in fact, be preserved.

 either use the version of `init` which sets all render-relevant properites, or else defer
 setting `text` until last.  For example:

     labelNode.fontColor = [SKColor blueColor];

 In iOS 9 and later, the configured text will wrap so that no line is longer than the
 maximum width.  In the current implementation, the line will prefer to break on word
 boundaries.  If constrained by a long word, it will not hyphenate, but will break on
 letter boundaries.  If constrained so that even a single letter doesn't fit on the line,
 it will visually truncate the letter.

 Before iOS 9, the `widthMaximum` is more approximate; the label width will be near, but
 not necessarily less than, the maximum.
