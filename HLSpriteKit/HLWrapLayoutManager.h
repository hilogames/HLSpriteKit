/**
 The anchor point used for setting the position of each node in its line.

 Since each line is laid out in only one dimension, each cell has only one anchor point
 value, either X or Y depending on whether the line is horizontal or vertical.

 When performing a layout, the wrap layout manager allocates a cell (of a certain length)
 for each node.  The node is then positioned in that cell according to the cell anchor
 point.  For horizontal lines, anchor point `0.0` is the left edge of the cell and `1.0`
 is the right edge; for vertical lines, anchor point `0.0` is the bottom edge of the cell
 and `1.0` is the top edge; for both, anchor point `0.5` is the center of the cell.

 For now, all cells in a wrap layout must share the same anchor point, which probably
 corresponds closely to the nodes that will be laid out: the anchor point of all the
 sprite nodes and the alignment modes of all the label nodes.  It's worth noting, though,
 that the layout manager ignores the current anchor points or alignments of the nodes
 during layout.

 Default value is `0.5`.

 This property is included in the layout manager to be consistent with other layout
 managers, but its size is possibly misleading in both dimensions.  In the dimension of
 the lines (either horizontal or vertical depending on `fillMode`), the size is the
 largest line length (including borders and separators).  In the other dimension, the size
 is the distance from the first line to the last (since the wrap manager is not aware of
 extent of the nodes in that dimension).
