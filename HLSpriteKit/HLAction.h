 The `HLAction` system provides a stateful alternative to the `SKAction` system.

 ## Goals and Features

 ### Similarity to `SKAction`

 For example:

     #import "HLSpriteKit/HLAction.h"
     #import "HLSpriteKit/SKNode+HLAction.h"

     [_orcNode hlRunAction:[HLAction sequence:@[ [HLAction animateWithTextures:_orcDeathFrames timePerFrame:0.2],
                                                 [HLAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                                 [HLAction fadeOutWithDuration:3.0],
                                                 [HLAction removeFromParent] ]]
                   withKey:@"orc-death"];

 ### Control of (and Responsibility for) the Runloop

 The `SKScene` evaluates actions as part of its scene-wide frame processing (immediately
 after calling the scene's `update:` method).  By contrast, `HLAction` updates must be
 done explicitly.  To continue the previous example, in the scene implementation:

      - (void)update:(NSTimeInterval)currentTime
      {
        static NSTimeInterval lastTime = 0.0;
        NSTimeInterval incrementalTime = 0.0;
        if (lastTime > 0.0) {
          incrementalTime = currentTime - lastTime;
        }
        lastTime = currentTime;

        [_orcNode hlActionRunnerUpdate:incrementalTime];
      }

 Needless to say, this is deeply annoying.

 However, it does give complete control over the runloop, which is an advantage in some
 situations:

  * ordering updates and animations

  * sanitizing a standard game clock (to deal with slow frame rates or non-atomic system
    clocks)

  * handling game paused state, or simulation speed

 ### Statefulness During Encoding and Decoding

 `HLAction` actions, in contrast to `SKAction` actions, are mutable and stateful.

 A motivating use-case for `HLAction` is to persist animation state during encoding and
 resume it on decoding.

 Suppose that whenever an orc is killed in a game, an `SKAction` sequence runs: first, the
 orc node staggers and falls by means of a texture animation; then, the orc node fades out
 slowly over three seconds; then, the orc node is removed from the scene.

 Suppose, in the middle of that death fade, the user backgrounds the app (or saves the
 game), encoding it.

 When the game is resumed (and decoded), it would be nice if the orc corpse continued
 fading.  Even better would be if it matched pixel-perfect with the screenshot taken by
 iOS during application state preservation.

 Such fidelity is difficult using the `SKAction` system.  Here are the common
 possibilities:

  * If the entire orc node is encoded using `NSCoding`, then the ongoing `SKAction`
    animation sequence will successfully encode, decode, and resume.  Unfortunately,
    though, it does not encode its progress or its original state, and so it starts over
    from the beginning of the sequence without resetting alpha.  In the example, this
    means that the partly-faded orc will hop back on its ghostly feet in order to stagger
    and fall once again.

  * If the orc node is not encoded, but instead recreated on restoration, then no
    `SKAction` animation sequence will resume.  Either the orc node will disappear, or it
    will stay around indefinitely, or the app must figure out how to preserve and restore
    the state of the animation sequence.

 `HLAction` solves this problem by representing the state of all animations in encodable
 objects only loosely coupled to a particular node.

 Continuing the example of this section, the `HLAction` sequence would be encoded as
 follows.  If the entire node is encoded, no special code is required:

     - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
     {
       [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];
       [aCoder encodeObject:_orcNode forKey:@"orcNode"];
     }

     - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder
     {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       if (self) {
         // The HLActionRunner was encoded as part of the node's userData, and will resume
         // where it left off at the next call to [_orcNode hlActionRunnerUpdate:].
         _orcNode = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:"orcNode"];
       }
       return self;
     }

 Typically, though, the game wants to keep nodes out of the archive, and recreate them on
 decode.  In that case, you can encode and decode just the action runner:

     - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
     {
       [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];
       [aCoder encodeObject:_orcNode.hlActionRunner forKey:@"orcNodeActionRunner"];
     }

     - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder
     {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       if (self) {
         // ... (after recreating _orcNode) ...
         HLActionRunner *orcNodeActionRunner = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:"orcNodeActionRunner"];
         if (orcNodeActionRunner) {
           [_orcNode hlSetActionRunner:orcNodeActionRunner];
         }
       }
       return self;
     }

 Sometimes it makes sense to only encode certain named actions, and intentionally discard
 the rest:

     - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
     {
       [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];
       HLAction *deathAction = [_orcNode hlActionForKey:@"orc-death"];
       if (deathAction) {
         [aCoder encodeObject:deathAction forKey:@"orcNodeDeathAction"];
       }
     }

     - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder
     {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       if (self) {
         // ... (after recreating _orcNode) ...
         HLAction *deathAction = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:"orcNodeDeathAction"];
         if (deathAction) {
           [_orcNode hlRunAction:deathAction withKey:@"orc-death"];
         }
       }
       return self;
     }

 One last encoding-related feature: `HLAction` works around problems encoding block-based
 actions.  In particular, attempting to encode `SKAction`'s `runBlock:` or
 `customActionWithDuration:actionBlock:` leads to a runtime warning message:

    > SKAction: Run block actions can not be properly encoded, Objective-C
    > blocks do not support NSCoding.

 `HLAction` provides alternatives which encode selectors and arguments rather than blocks
 (see `HLCustomAction` and `HLPerformSelector*Action`).

 ### Loose Coupling With Node

 All the examples so far have shown an action running while "attached" to a node (using
 class category `SKNode+HLAction`).

 The actions and action runner, however, can be operated independently of the node.

 For instance, a single action can be instantiated and updated by itself:

     HLAnimateTexturesAction *summonAction = [HLAction animateWithTextures:_elfSummonFrames timePerFrame:0.2];
     ...
     [summonAction update:incrementalTime node:_elfNode];

 ...or as part of a group or sequence:

     HLGroupAction *summonActions = [HLAction group:@[ [HLAction animateWithTextures:_elfSummonFrames timePerFrame:0.2],
                                                       [HLAction fadeInWithDuration:2.0] ]];
     ...
     [summonActions update:incrementalTime node:_elfNode];

 ...or in a standalone action runner:

     HLActionRunner *elfActionRunner = [[HLActionRunner alloc] init];
     [elfActionRunner runAction:[HLAction animateWithTextures:_elfSummonFrames timePerFrame:0.2]
                        withKey:@"summon-animate"];
     [elfActionRunner runAction:[HLAction fadeInWithDuration:2.0]
                        withKey:@"summon-fade"];
     ...
     [elfActionRunner update:incrementalTime node:_elfNode];

 In fact, the actions can be used to model animation state without ever explicitly
 animating a node.  To use an action like this, pass `nil` for the node parameter during
 the update, and access the state of the action using its public interface.  To repeat the
 "single action" example from above:

     HLAnimateTexturesAction *summonAction = [HLAction animateWithTextures:_elfSummonFrames timePerFrame:0.2];
     ...
     [summonAction update:incrementalTime node:nil];
     SKTexture *currentTexture = summonAction.texture;
     for (SKSpriteNode *elfNode in _summonElfNodes) {
       elfNode.texture = currentTexture;
     }
     NSLog(@"summon %g of %g seconds elapsed", summonAction.elapsedTime, summonAction.duration);

 One complication: Many `SKAction` actions require a node.  For instance, `[SKAction
 moveTo:duration:]` needs a node to know where to move *from*.  To support
 node-independent use of this kind of action, the corresponding `HLAction` provides an
 initializer accepting the missing information:

     // use this initializer if a node will be provided during update
     HLAction *moveAction = [HLAction moveTo:destination duration:1.0];

     // use this initializer if a node will not be provided during update
     HLAction *moveAction = [HLAction moveFrom:origin to:destination duration:1.0];
     moveAction.timingMode = HLActionTimingModeEaseInEaseOut;
     ...
     [moveAction update:incrementalTime node:nil];
     CGPoint currentPosition = moveAction.position;
     NSLog(@"current position %g,%g", currentPosition.x, currentPosition.y);

 ### Extensible and Open-Source

 `HLAction` will probably never be as fully-featured as `SKAction`, but it's worth
 mentioning: It is extensible, so you can write your own custom actions by descending from
 the `HLAction` parent class, and it is open-source, so you can see how it works.

 ## Important Differences Between `HLAction` and `SKAction`

 Because `SKAction` actions are immutable, they can be created once and run multiple
 times, on the same node or on different nodes.  `HLAction` actions, on the other hand,
 are stateful, and so should not be reused.  Running a single `HLAction` in two different
 action-runners at the same time, for instance, would advance its elapsed time twice as
 fast as expected.

 ## Possibilities

 ### Modification of Action State

 `HLAction` actions are mutable, and their state is publically accessible, which suggests
 some interesting possibilities.

  * What should happen if `timingMode` is changed while an action is running?

  * Can `elapsedTime` be freely modified?

  * Can `duration` be modified while an action is running?

  * On an action like `HLMoveToAction`, can the origin or destination points be changed
    while the action is running?

 For now almost all state is marked readonly, to protect against unintended consequences
 and to simplify implementation.

 ### Backwards Time

 In the current implementation, `speed` and `incrementalTime` are both constrained to be
 non-negative.  But backwards time might be useful, and reasonable to implement.

 The incremental time passed in to an action `update:node:` is in the time frame of the

 `timingMode`.

  * Say the action has speed of `2.0` and a linear time mode.  After an update of `0.1`
    incremental seconds, its `elapsedTime` will be `0.2` seconds.

  * Say the action has normal speed and a time mode of `HLActionTimeEaseIn`.  After an
    update of `0.1` incremental seconds, its `elapsedTime` will be quite a bit less than
    `0.1`, according to the cubic easing function.

When complete, `elapsedTime` won't necessarily match the action's `duration`:

  * The final `elapsedTime` will include extra time from the final update.

  * Collections like `HLSequenceAction` or `HLGroupAction` complete when their actions are
    complete, which (depending on the speeds of their sub-actions) might result in a final
    `elapsedTime` that is wildly different than the `duration`.

 ### Discussion: Node and Action Runner Speed

 `HLAction` promotes loose coupling between node and action; importantly, the action
 runner regards the `node` parameter as optional during updates.  Therefore, the speed
 argument to the update is separated from the node argument, and the node's `speed`
 parameter is ignored.  By example: An update without a node can still have a speed:

     [_orcActionRunner update:incrementalTime node:nil speed:2.0];

 Or, if the node exists and is being passed to the update, the speed will have to be
 passed explicitly also:

     [_orcActionRunner update:incrementalTime node:orcNode speed:orcNode.speed];

 (Alternately, the `incrementalTime` parameter could be multiplied by the caller, but that
 would make things more obscure.)

 On one hand, the extra typing is annoying.  On the other hand, it allows `HLAction` to
 meet its loose-coupling goal.  It also supports a second goal, namely, to immitate
 `SKAction` as much as possible: If the action runner is updated using the class category
 `SKNode+HLAction`, then the node's speed will automatically be passed to this method.

/**
 An action that progresses through an array of textures, considered as frames of an
 animation.

 If this action is being repeated, consider using `HLLoopTexturesAction` as an
 alternative; see the third and fourth encoding examples, below, for motivation.

 ### Notes

 * In the pause between frame changes, calls to `update:node:` will repeatedly set the
   current texture.  This matches the behavior of `SKAction animateWithTextures:*`.

 ### Encoding Examples

 1. Encode the animate-textures action along with the node.  (No special encoding or
    decoding code required.)

 2. Recreate the node on decoding; encode the animate-textures action separately.

     - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
     {
       [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];
       HLAction *deathAction = [_orcNode hlActionForKey:@"orc-death"];
       if (deathAction) {
         [aCoder encodeObject:deathAction forKey:@"orcNodeDeathAction"];
       }
     }

     - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder
     {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       if (self) {
         // ... (after recreating _orcNode) ...
         HLAction *deathAction = [aDecoder decodeObjectForKey:"orcNodeDeathAction"];
         if (deathAction) {
           [_orcNode hlRunAction:deathAction withKey:@"orc-death"];
         }
       }
       return self;
     }

 3. Recreate both the node and the action on decoding (perhaps to save some encoding
    space).  In this case, the essential bit of the animation state to preserve and
    restore is the current frame of the animation.

     - (void)encodeWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aCoder
     {
       [super encodeWithCoder:aCoder];
       HLAction *deathAction = [_orcNode hlActionForKey:@"orc-death"];
       if (deathAction) {
         [aCoder encodeInteger:(NSInteger)deathAction.textureIndex forKey:@"orcNodeDeathActionTextureIndex"];
       }
     }

     - (instancetype)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder
     {
       self = [super initWithCoder:aDecoder];
       if (self) {
         // ... (after recreating _orcNode) ...
         if ([aDecoder containsValueForKey:@"orcNodeDeathActionTextureIndex"]) {
           NSUInteger textureIndex = (NSUInteger)[aDecoder decodeIntegerForKey:@"orcNodeDeathActionTextureIndex"];
           _orcNode.texture = _orcDeathFrames[textureIndex];
           NSArray *remainingFrames = [_orcDeathFrames subarrayWithRange:NSMakeRange(texureIndex, [_orcDeathFrames count] - textureIndex)];
           [_orcNode hlRunAction:[HLAction animateWithTextures:remainingFrames
                                                  timePerFrame:HLOrcDeathTimePerFrame]
                         withKey:@"orc-death"];
         }
       }
       return self;
     }

 4. Recreate both the node and the action on decoding for an animate-textures action which
    is repeated.  In this case, the first animate-textures action in the repeat must be
    created as in (3), but then the remaining ones be recreated starting at frame 0, which
    means creating a sequence containing the first action and the repeated remaining actions,
    which is ponderous.  If possible, use `HLLoopTexturesAction` instead, which handles
    this more gracefully (using a designated starting frame).

 An action that repeatedly cycles through an array of textures, considered as frames of an

 One key feature: A starting frame index may be specified for the animation loop.  This is
 useful in two situations:

  * When recreating a loop-texures animation (perhaps during encoding) that was halted at
    a specific frame.

 A non-durational action that performs a selector on a target.

 This variant retains the target weakly and passes no arguments to the selector.

 ## Avoid Retain Cycles

 The perform-selector provided by SpriteKit retains its target strongly, which can lead to
 a retain cycle when the target is the node running the action.  For example, a sequence
 like this is problematic:

     SKAction *delayedPing = [SKAction sequence:@[ [SKAction waitForDuration:1.0],
                                                   [SKAction performSelector:@selector(ping) onTarget:self] ]];
     [self runAction:delayedPing];

 If, during the one-second wait, this node is removed from parent, then its actions will
 be paused (not released!), and the node and action will retain each other strongly.

 To address this, `HLPerformSelectorWeakAction` (and its variants) retain their target
 weakly.

 This module contains "strong" variants of the perform-selector which correspond more
 closely to the behavior of `performSelector:onTarget:`.  They are not recommended.

 A commonly-useful encodable user data object to use with `HLCustomAction`.

 A common use case for `HLCustomAction` is tweening between two values (whether position,
 alpha, scale, or something else), which can be tracked by this user data object.  In the
 following example, a user data object is provided to the custom action in order to track
 a start and finish value for an overshooting slide.
